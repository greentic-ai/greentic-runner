# Assert the two crates.io publish lanes agree on which crates they publish.
#
# `release-binaries.yml` (tag `v*`) and `crates-publish.yml` (tag
# `runnercrates-v*`) both call the shared greenticai/.github publish workflow.
# The list is duplicated in the two files with nothing keeping them in sync.
#
# When they drift, the damage is silent and only shows up mid-release: cargo
# strips `path` when packaging, so each crate is verified against its
# dependencies as resolved from crates.io. A workspace sibling missing from the
# list is resolved to whatever older version is already published, which builds
# fine until a release first has a dependent call a newly added API. That is
# exactly how v1.1.10 half-published (#655) — runner-core went out, then
# greentic-runner-host failed to verify against a stale greentic-aw-runtime.
#
# Order matters as much as membership: the shared workflow waits for index
# propagation between crates, so a dependency must appear before every crate
# that needs it. This compares the lists verbatim, order included.
